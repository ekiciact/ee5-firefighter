# FireGuardian: Firefighter Situational Awareness Dashboard

## Overview
FireGuardian is a web-based dashboard designed to enhance situational awareness for firefighting teams. It provides visual tools such as heat maps, simulations, and data analysis to assist in the efficient allocation of resources and decision-making during fire incidents.

## Features
- **Heat Maps**: Interactive heat maps to visualize fire intensity and spread.
- **Average Heat Analysis**: An overview of temperature data trends across regions.
- **Simulation View**: Fire spread simulation to assist in planning response strategies.
- **Data Tables**: Structured data representation to provide a clear overview of metrics.
- **Time-based Heat Analysis**: Visualizes heat variation over time to aid in tracking fire dynamics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fireguardian.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

3. Install the required dependencies (e.g., using Node.js or a preferred backend setup).

## Usage
- Open `home.html` in your browser to view the main dashboard.
- Use the navigation bar to switch between different views, such as heat maps, simulations, and data tables.

## File Structure
- **Views**: Contains HTML files for different visual components of the dashboard (e.g., `heatmap.html`, `sim.html`).
